# Vim Plugins
This is a collection of the plugins I use in Vim, mostly for PHP development. 

I did not make any of these plugins. Please see the respective repos for licences, credits, etc.

## Installation
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/seb-jones/vim-plugins.git ~/.vim/pack/seb-jones/start
```

In addition, the `phpcd` plugin needs a `composer install` to work properly:
```
cd ~/.vim/pack/seb-jones/start/phpcd.vim
composer install
```
